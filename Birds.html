        <img src="Parrot.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">        
        <p>Parrots are known for their intelligence, unique personalities, long lifespan 
            (in some species, over 30 years!) and striking colouring. Some varieties, 
            such as African Greys, Amazons and Quakers have tremendous vocal ability, 
            resulting in the capacity to mimic the human voice, much to their owner’s delight.</p>

        <h4>HUMMINGBIRD</h4></center>
        <img src="hummingbird.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>LeBaron says some ruby-throated hummingbirds (pictured) fly 500 miles nonstop across 
            the Gulf of Mexico during both spring and fall migrations. Others will stick to the  
            coast and travel the longer route down the edge of Texas instead.</p>

        <img src="CROW.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>These are birds with a robust and slender appearance, equipped with a small,
             rounded head with a strong, conical beak, elongated and pointed, with a 
             slightly curved end towards the bottom; the legs are strong and the tail

        <h4>PIGRON</h4></center>
        <img src="pigeon.jfif" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>Pigeons possess extraordinary navigation abilities and can sense the earth's magnetic field, 
            which is surprising since they are not a migratory species. Young birds are raced short 
            distances of 160 to 500km, </p>

        <img src="istockphoto.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>Cranes are powerful flyers, with some having the ability to fly over the Himalayas. During migration 
            cranes fly with their head and neck straight out and their feet and legs straight behind them.
             They are able to reach heights of 4,900–8,000 meters</p>

        <img src="istockphoto-2.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p> Toucans are best known for their large, colorful bills, which can be four times the size of their
             head. They use their beak to reach food far out on branches or deep into tree cavities. Finding
              and catching food is aided by a toucan's long tongue</p>
